## Introduction

[Nuggets](https://nuggets.life/) is an e-commerce payments and ID platform. It stores user's personal and payment data securely; data is end-to-end encrypted, so not even Nuggets can see the data passing through & stored on our systems.

Users decide if and when they want to share their data, and do so on their own terms.

The `did:nuggets:` [DID Method](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#methods) is used to resolve the DID Documents for partners on the Nuggets system, so that users can securely interact with other parties on the system via encryption, signing & verification of data.
